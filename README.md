This is the landing readme for the session I performed at VMware Explore 2023.
Link to the catalog with the session: https://event.vmware.com/flow/vmware/explore2023lv/content/page/catalog?search=NSCB1632LV



You will find 3 different spaces related to "Choose your own adventure".

Each adventure will be a seperate folder, and those folders will contain supporting code, links, etc.

I expect to update them with more information, before, just before, and after my session.
